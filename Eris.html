    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Eris is one of the most distant and massive objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune filled with icy bodies. It was discovered in 2005 and played a key role in the redefinition of what constitutes a planet, leading to the creation of the "dwarf planet" category by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. Eris is known for its highly reflective surface, which suggests it is covered with a layer of nitrogen-rich ice or methane frost. Its discovery challenged our understanding of the solar system's outer regions, as its mass slightly exceeds that of Pluto, despite being smaller in diameter.</p>
    <h3>Unique Features and Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Extremely Eccentric Orbit:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Eris_Orbit.svg" alt="" id="MImages">Eris has one of the most eccentric orbits of any known dwarf planet, ranging from about 38 AU to 97 AU from the Sun, taking it well outside the plane of the solar system.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Highly Inclined Orbit:</span>Its orbit is tilted at an angle of about 44 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system, a rarity among solar system objects.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Coldest Known Surface:</span> Due to its extreme distance from the Sun, Eris is one of the coldest objects in the solar system, with temperatures so low that its atmosphere freezes onto its surface during parts of its orbit.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Slow Rotation Mystery:</span>Eris rotates surprisingly slowly compared to many other celestial bodies, which scientists believe may be due to tidal interactions with its moon, Dysnomia.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Surface Composition Clues:</span>Spectral analysis indicates the presence of methane ice, which reflects sunlight, giving Eris its bright and shiny appearance.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Discovery Sparked Debate:</span>Eris was initially thought to be larger than Pluto, which fueled the debate over Pluto’s planetary status and led to the reclassification of both as dwarf planets.</li><br>
        <li><span>Comparable Brightness to Pluto:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/1082px-Hubble_Dysnomia_orbit_overlay.jpg" alt="" id="MImages">Eris is one of the brightest objects in the Kuiper Belt, with a surface reflectivity (albedo) nearly as high as Pluto’s, making it visible to telescopes despite its immense distance.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Exploration and Missions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <p>no spacecraft has visited Eris directly yet. All data about Eris has come from Earth-based telescopes, like the Hubble Space Telescope, and distant observations from missions such as New Horizons, which has provided some insights into Kuiper Belt objects but has not visited Eris itself. Proposed missions to Eris remain theoretical, as its immense distance from Earth (about 96.4 AU) makes it a challenging target for exploration.</p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br>
    </ul>
    <div id="Beyond">Fun Fact!
        <h6>Eris is so massive that its gravitational influence helped determine the upper size limit for objects in the Kuiper Belt that could potentially be classified as planets, cementing its role as a defining factor in the creation of the "dwarf planet" category.</h6>
