    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Deimos is the smaller and outermost of Mars’ two moons, the other being Phobos. Named after the Greek god of dread, Deimos orbits Mars at a distance of approximately 23,460 kilometers, completing one orbit every 30.3 hours. Its surface is covered with a thick layer of regolith, giving it a smooth and dusty appearance compared to other moons. Deimos lacks substantial geological features such as large craters or mountains, which makes it unique. Its low gravity allows loose material to accumulate, forming a soft, powdery layer. With an average temperature ranging from -4°C during the day to -112°C at night, it is a cold and desolate celestial body.</p>
    <h3>Unique Features and Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Tiny and Distant: </span>  <br> <br> <img src="Images file/1599px-Moon_Phobos_Deimos.png" alt="" id="MImages">Deimos is the smaller and more distant of Mars' two moons, located around 23,460 km away from the planet, which is about three times farther than Phobos.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Slow Orbit:</span>  It orbits Mars at a much slower pace compared to many moons of other planets, taking about 30.3 hours to complete one orbit.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Synchronous Rotation:</span> Deimos always shows the same face to Mars due to its synchronous rotation, meaning its rotation period matches its orbit around the planet.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Low Gravity:</span> <br> <br> <img src="#" alt="" id="MImages">With its tiny size and low mass, Deimos has very weak gravity, making it difficult for anything to stay anchored to its surface.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Lack of Atmosphere:</span> Deimos has no atmosphere, so its surface is exposed to space's harsh conditions, including solar winds and cosmic radiation.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Smooth Surface:</span> The moon's surface is unusually smooth, with few large craters, likely due to its low gravity, which prevents large impacts from creating deeper depressions.</li><br>
        <li><span>Possibly Captured Asteroid:</span> It's believed that Deimos, like Phobos, might be a captured asteroid from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Exploration and Missions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span>NASA's Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971:</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/1971_may_mariner09.jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> Mariner 9 was the first spacecraft to orbit another planet, and during its mission, it provided detailed images of both Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, revealing their cratered surfaces and irregular shapes.</p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
        <li><span>Emirates Mars Mission (EMM):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/EMM_1080x1080-768x768.png" alt="" id="MImage"> In April 2023, the United Arab Emirates' Hope Probe conducted a series of flybys of Deimos, capturing high-resolution images and collecting data on its composition and geology. These observations provided new insights into the moon's origin and its relationship with Mars.</p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br> <br> <br>
        <li><span>Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) Mission:</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/download (2).avif" alt="" id="MImage"> Developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the MMX mission is scheduled to launch in 2024. Its primary objective is to explore both Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, to determine their origins and gather samples. The spacecraft will land on Phobos to collect surface material and conduct detailed observations of Deimos during flybys. The mission aims to return samples to Earth by 2029.</p>

    <div id="Beyond">Fun Fact!
        <h6>Deimos orbits so far from Mars that it appears as a tiny dot in the Martian sky, resembling a bright star rather than a traditional moon. Its slow orbit means it would take about 2.7 days to rise and set for an observer standing on Mars!</h6>
