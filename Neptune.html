    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is a gas giant known for its striking blue color, caused by the absorption of red light by its methane-rich atmosphere. With extremely strong winds reaching up to 2,100 kilometers per hour, Neptune experiences some of the fastest winds in the solar system. Its iconic Great Dark Spot is a massive storm system similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot. The planet has a dense core surrounded by a thick mantle of water, ammonia, and methane, and a thin outer atmosphere. Despite its remoteness, Neptune has a strong gravitational influence and a unique ring system composed of tiny particles.</p>
    <h3>Unique Features and Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Windiest Planet:</span>Neptune has the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 miles per hour).</li> <br>
        <li><span>Rings and Arcs:</span> Neptune's ring system is faint and consists of five main rings, but its most distinctive feature is its "ring arcs," clumps of particles concentrated in specific regions.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Triton’s Retrograde Orbit:</span> Neptune’s largest moon, Triton, has a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits in the opposite direction of Neptune's rotation. This suggests Triton may have been captured by Neptune's gravity.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Intense Magnetic Field:</span>Neptune has a magnetic field that is tilted relative to its rotation axis, and it’s 27 times stronger than Earth's.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Discovered Through Math:</span>Neptune was the first planet to be discovered through mathematical predictions rather than direct observation.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Cold, But Dynamic:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Neptune_clouds.jpg" alt="" id="MImages">Even though Neptune is extremely cold, it has active weather patterns, including large storms and cloud formations that vary in size and shape.</li><br>
        <li><span>Atmosphere Layering:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Another_Neptune_diagram.svg" alt="" id="MImages">Neptune’s atmosphere is layered, with a mixture of hydrogen, helium, and methane at the top, and deeper layers containing more complex molecules like water and ammonia.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Exploration and Missions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span>NASA's Voyager 2. Launched in 1977:</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/images (2).jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> Voyager 2 conducted a flyby of Neptune on August 25, 1989, providing humanity's first close-up images and data of the planet. This mission marked the end of the Voyager program's Grand Tour of the outer planets.</p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br> <br>
        <li>
        <p>Neptune has been explored by only one spacecraft: NASA's Voyager 2. Since then, no other missions have visited Neptune. However, there are ongoing discussions and proposals for future missions to explore Neptune and its moons, such as Triton. For instance, the Trident mission concept, proposed in 2019, aimed to conduct a flyby of Neptune and Triton. Despite its selection for further study, it was not chosen for funding in the subsequent Discovery Program rounds.</p>

    <div id="Beyond">Fun Fact!
        <h6>Neptune experiences "diamond rain." Due to the extreme pressure and heat within the planet, scientists believe that carbon in Neptune's atmosphere might form diamonds. These diamonds could rain down through the planet’s interior, creating a fascinating and unique phenomenon that scientists are still studying.</h6>
