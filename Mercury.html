    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the one closest to the Sun. Its surface is rocky and heavily cratered, resembling the Moon, and it lacks any moons of its own. Being so close to the Sun, Mercury experiences intense solar radiation, which has shaped its landscape over billions of years. The planet's thin exosphere is made up of atoms blasted off its surface by solar winds and micrometeoroid impacts. Mercury’s surface features include vast plains, cliffs, and impact craters, revealing a history of geological activity. Its small size and dense composition make it unique among the rocky planets.</p>
    <h3>Unique Features and Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Closest Planet to the Sun:</span> Mercury is the nearest planet to the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of just 57.91 million kilometers.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Smallest Planet:</span>  <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Terrestrial_planet_size_comparisons-2.jpg" alt="" id="MImages"> It’s the smallest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of only 4,880 kilometers.</li> <br>
        <li><span>No Atmosphere:</span> Mercury has almost no atmosphere, allowing meteoroids to leave countless impact craters on its surface.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Ice in Shadowed Craters:</span> Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury’s permanently shadowed craters at the poles contain water ice.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Caloris Basin:</span> One of the largest impact craters in the solar system, spanning about 1,550 kilometers.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Shrinking Planet:</span> Mercury is slowly shrinking due to its cooling interior, causing its surface to form wrinkles known as "lobate scarps."</li><br>
        <li><span>Magnetic Field:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Mercury_with_magnetic_field.svg" alt="" id="MImages"> Mercury is the only terrestrial planet besides Earth to have a significant magnetic field.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Exploration and Missions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Mariner 10 (1973–1975):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/missionswebmariner10_Kia3Yjl.width-1280.jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> Launched by NASA, Mariner 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Mercury. It conducted three flybys—one of Venus and two of Mercury—using gravity assists to adjust its trajectory. Mariner 10 provided the first close-up images of Mercury's surface, revealing a planet covered in craters similar to our Moon.</p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br>
        <li><span>MESSENGER (2011–2015):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/th.jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> The MESSENGER mission, also by NASA, orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015. It provided detailed maps of the planet's surface, studied its magnetic field, and discovered water ice in permanently shadowed craters near the poles.</p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br>
        <li><span>BepiColombo (2018–Present):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/BepiColombo_MPO-MMO_illustration_1280.jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> A joint mission by the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, it was launched in 2018. It is currently en route to Mercury, with plans to enter orbit in late 2025. The mission aims to study Mercury's composition, geophysics, atmosphere, and magnetosphere. In January 2025, it conducted a flyby of Mercury, capturing high-resolution images of the planet's surface, including the north pole. These images revealed permanently shadowed craters and volcanic plains, providing new insights into Mercury's geology.</p>

    <div id="Beyond">Fun Fact!
        <h6>Mercury has the shortest day of any planet in the solar system! A single day on Mercury (the time it takes for the planet to complete one full rotation on its axis) lasts just 59 Earth days, which is shorter than its year (the time it takes to orbit the Sun), which lasts 88 Earth days. This means that a day on Mercury is actually longer than a year on Mercury!</h6>
