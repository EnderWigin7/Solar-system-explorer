    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in our solar system, known for its stunning and extensive ring system. It is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. Saturn’s atmosphere consists of thick clouds, and its weather systems include violent storms, including the famous hexagonal storm at the north pole. The planet's magnetic field is strong, and it radiates more energy than it receives from the Sun, possibly due to the planet's slow contraction. Saturn's moon Titan is notable for its thick atmosphere and potential for harboring life. With 145 known moons, Saturn stands as one of the most fascinating objects in the solar system.</p>
    <h3>Unique Features and Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Rings:</span>Saturn’s iconic rings are made of ice, rock, and dust, and stretch over 280,000 kilometers in diameter, yet are only about 1 kilometer thick.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Titan:</span> Saturn’s moon Titan is larger than Mercury and has a thick atmosphere, with lakes of liquid methane and ethane, possibly resembling early Earth conditions.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Hexagonal Storm:</span> Saturn’s north pole hosts a bizarre, persistent hexagonal storm pattern, a mysterious feature not found anywhere else in the solar system.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Low Density: </span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Saturn_diagram.svg" alt="" id="MImages">Saturn is so light that if placed in a large enough body of water, it would float, as its average density is lower than water’s.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Fast Winds:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Saturn_Storm.jpg" alt="" id="MImages">Winds in Saturn’s atmosphere can reach speeds of up to 1,800 kilometers per hour (1,100 miles per hour), creating turbulent weather systems.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Magnetic Field:</span> Saturn’s magnetic field is about 578 times stronger than Earth’s, contributing to stunning auroras at the planet's poles.</li><br>
        <li><span>Lightning Strikes:</span> Saturn experiences massive lightning storms, with strikes up to 1,000 times more powerful than those on Earth.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Exploration and Missions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span>First Mission: Pioneer 11:</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/images (1).jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> Launched in 1973, NASA's Pioneer 11 was the first spacecraft to fly by Saturn. In September 1979, it passed within 20,000 kilometers of Saturn's cloud tops, capturing images and data that revealed the intricate structure of Saturn's rings and provided the first close-up observations of the planet's atmosphere. </p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
        <li><span>Cassini-Huygens Mission (2004–2017):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/hq720.webp" alt="" id="MImage"> Launched in 1997, the Cassini spacecraft entered orbit around Saturn on July 1, 2004. Over the next 13 years, it conducted detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere, rings, and moons, including the discovery of water-ice geysers on Enceladus and the detection of a subsurface ocean beneath Titan's icy crust.</p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 
        <li><span>Huygens Probe:</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/HuygensProbe2-300x225.jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> Carried by Cassini, the Huygens probe descended through Titan's thick atmosphere on January 14, 2005, landing on the moon's surface and transmitting data back to Earth, providing the first direct measurements of Titan's atmospheric composition and surface conditions.</p>

    <div id="Beyond">Fun Fact!
        <h6>Saturn’s moon Titan has seas and lakes made not of water, but of liquid methane and ethane! Titan is the only known moon in the solar system with stable liquids on its surface. These hydrocarbon lakes create a unique and alien landscape, and scientists are excited to explore the possibility of life—albeit very different from life on Earth—existing in such an environment.</h6>
