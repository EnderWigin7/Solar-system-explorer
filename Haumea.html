    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Haumea is a fascinating dwarf planet located in the outer reaches of our solar system, in the Kuiper Belt. It is one of the few objects that exhibits a distinct, elongated shape due to its rapid rotation. The dwarf planet is primarily composed of rock and water ice, with its surface being heavily impacted by cosmic collisions. Haumea is also believed to have a relatively young surface, with minimal cratering. Its unique shape and characteristics may be attributed to tidal forces caused by its moons. Haumea is considered one of the most mysterious objects in the outer solar system due to its unusual features and remote location.</p>
    <h3>Unique Features and Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Rapid Rotation:</span>Haumea completes a full rotation in just about 4 hours, making it one of the fastest-spinning objects in the solar system.</li> <br>
        <li style="background-color: white; display: inline-block; width: 777px; height: 730px;"><span>Egg-Shaped Appearance:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Haumea.svg" alt="" id="MImages" style="display: block; width: 777px;">Due to its rapid spin, Haumea is not spherical but rather shaped like an ellipsoid, resembling an egg.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Surface Composition:</span> Its surface is covered mostly by crystalline water ice, which distinguishes it from many other icy bodies in the Kuiper Belt.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Tidal Heating: </span>Haumea’s moons, Hiʻiaka and Namaka, cause tidal interactions, which may contribute to its internal heating, keeping it relatively geologically active.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Lack of Atmosphere:</span>Haumea has no detectable atmosphere, which is typical for dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Unusual Density:</span>Haumea has an unusually high density for a Kuiper Belt object, suggesting a substantial rock core surrounded by a layer of ice.</li><br>
        <li><span>One of the Largest Kuiper Belt Objects:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/#" alt="" id="MImages">It is one of the largest objects in the Kuiper Belt, making it significant in the study of distant solar system bodies.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Exploration and Missions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <p>As of now, no dedicated missions have been launched to explore Haumea directly. However, the New Horizons spacecraft, which conducted a historic flyby of Pluto in July 2015, has performed several observations of Haumea during its journey through the Kuiper Belt. These observations occurred in October 2007, January 2017, and May 2020, from distances of 49 AU, 59 AU, and 63 AU, respectively. These distant observations provided valuable data on Haumea's surface properties and helped refine our understanding of its characteristics.</p>

    <div id="Beyond">Fun Fact!
        <h6>Haumea is one of the few objects in the solar system that has a detectable ring system. A faint, narrow ring was discovered around it in 2017, making it the first known ring system around a Kuiper Belt object.</h6>
