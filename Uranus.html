    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is classified as an ice giant. Its atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives the planet its distinct blue-green color. The planet has a unique tilt, with its axis of rotation tilted at an angle of approximately 98 degrees, making it appear to roll on its side as it orbits the Sun. Uranus has a cold, featureless appearance due to its lack of significant cloud structures and its average temperature of around -224°C. It has a thin, faint ring system and is known for its strong winds, reaching speeds of up to 900 km/h (560 mph). The planet’s extreme tilt and its distant location make it one of the most mysterious and least explored planets in our solar system.</p>
    <h3>Unique Features and Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Extreme Tilt:</span>Uranus has a unique axial tilt of about 98 degrees, making it appear to roll on its side as it orbits the Sun.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Cold Atmosphere:</span> It is one of the coldest planets in the solar system, with an average temperature of around -224°C (-371°F).</li> <br>
        <li><span>Faint Rings:</span> Uranus has a system of faint, narrow rings made of ice and rock particles, discovered in 1977.</li> <br>
        <li><span>No Clear Seasons:</span>Due to its extreme tilt, Uranus experiences long periods of sunlight and darkness, leading to a lack of clear seasonal changes.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Blue-Green Color:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Uranus_diagram.svg" alt="" id="MImages">Its blue-green color comes from methane in the atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue and green light.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Strong Winds:</span> Despite its cold surface, Uranus experiences winds of up to 900 km/h (560 mph).</li><br>
        <li><span>Windstorm Activity:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Uranus_Dark_spot.jpg" alt="" id="MImages">Uranus has been observed to have massive storm systems, including large dark spots in its atmosphere that are thought to be storm systems similar to those on Neptune.</li><br>

    <h3>Exploration and Missions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Voyager 2 (1986):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/voyager_2_approaches_uranus__1986_01_24__by_eduardo_tarasca_dfnibzl-fullview.jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> The only spacecraft to have visited Uranus, NASA's Voyager 2 flew by the planet on January 24, 1986. It provided the first close-up images and data of Uranus, including details about its atmosphere, rings, and moons. It also discovered the planet's magnetic field and contributed to our understanding of its unusual tilt and composition.</p>

        <li>
        <p>As of now, Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus. Launched in 1977, it conducted a flyby of the planet on January 24, 1986, providing humanity's first close-up images and data of Uranus, its rings, and its moons. Since then, no other missions have been sent to Uranus. However, there are ongoing discussions and proposals for future missions to explore the planet further. For instance, NASA has been considering a mission called the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, which aims to study the planet's atmosphere, rings, and moons in greater detail. While these missions are still in the planning stages, they highlight the scientific community's interest in exploring Uranus and its unique characteristics.</p>

    <div id="Beyond">Fun Fact!
        <h6>Despite being an ice giant, Uranus has a surprisingly thin atmosphere. Its lower layers consist mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, but there’s much less of it compared to gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. This thin atmosphere contributes to the planet’s cold and featureless appearance.</h6>
