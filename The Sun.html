    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star located at the center of our solar system and serves as the primary source of energy for all life on Earth. It is an enormous, nearly spherical ball of glowing plasma, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, undergoing continuous nuclear fusion in its core. This process produces immense amounts of light and energy, which radiate outward to illuminate and warm the planets. The Sun's gravitational pull holds the solar system together, guiding the orbits of planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. As the most significant celestial body in our solar system, the Sun has been a source of wonder and study for civilizations throughout history.</p>
    <h3>Unique Features and Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span>The Heart of the Solar System:</span> The Sun contains 99.86% of the total mass of the solar system, making it the dominant gravitational force that keeps all the planets, moons, and other celestial bodies in orbit.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Source of Energy:</span> The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium in its core and releasing enormous amounts of light and heat.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Differential Rotation:</span> Unlike a solid object, the Sun's equator rotates faster (about 25 Earth days) than its poles (about 36 Earth days).</li> <br>
        <li><span>Layers of the Sun:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Sun_poster.svg" alt="" id="MImages"> The Sun is composed of several distinct layers, including the core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. The corona, visible during solar eclipses, extends millions of kilometers into space.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Sunspots and Solar Activity:</span> Sunspots are cooler, darker areas on the Sun's surface caused by intense magnetic activity. The Sun experiences an 11-year solar cycle, with periods of increased activity including solar flares and coronal mass ejections.</li> <br>
        <li><span>The Solar Wind:</span>The Sun constantly emits a stream of charged particles called the solar wind, which shapes planetary magnetospheres and creates phenomena like the auroras on Earth.</li><br>
        <li><span>It's Huge, But Not Unique:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Celestial_body_size_comparison_horizontal.png" alt="" id="MImages"> While massive, the Sun is just an average-sized star compared to others in the galaxy. Stars like Betelgeuse and Rigel are significantly larger.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Exploration and Missions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Parker Solar Probe:</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/1708_Parker-Solar-Probe_ObservingSun_1280.jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> Launched in 2018, NASA's Parker Solar Probe is humanity's first mission to 'touch' the Sun. It has made unprecedented close approaches to study the Sun's corona and solar wind, providing invaluable data about solar phenomena.  </p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br>
        <li><span>Aditya-L1:</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/aditya-l1-spacecraft-begins-its-journey-towards-the-sun-in-pslv-rocket.webp" alt="" id="MImage"> In September 2023, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched its first solar mission, Aditya-L1. This mission aims to study the Sun's outermost layers, including the photosphere and corona, enhancing our understanding of solar activities and their effects on space weather. </p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br>
        <li><span>Proba-3 Mission:</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file//Proba-3_formation-flying_pillars.jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> In December 2024, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched the Proba-3 mission. This mission employs two satellites flying in precise formation to create an artificial solar eclipse, allowing scientists to study the Sun's corona in detail without interference from its bright surface.</p>

    <div id="Beyond">Fun Fact!
        <h6>The Sun is actually white, not yellow! The Earth's atmosphere scatters shorter wavelengths of light, making the Sun appear yellow when viewed from the ground. In space, it shines in its true color—pure white.</h6>
