    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's “sister planet” due to its similar size, mass, and composition. Despite these similarities, Venus has a dramatically different environment. Its atmosphere is thick and mainly composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, which creates a surface pressure 92 times greater than Earth's. Venus has no moons and experiences a slow, retrograde rotation, meaning it rotates in the opposite direction to most planets. A Venusian day lasts longer than its year, with its rotation taking 243 Earth days. The planet's surface features vast plains, mountains, and large volcanic structures, some of which are believed to still be active. Due to its dense atmosphere and harsh conditions, Venus presents significant challenges for exploration, yet it remains a critical focus in the study of planetary geology and atmospheric sciences.</p>
    <h3>Unique Features and Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Extreme Surface Temperature:</span> Venus has a surface temperature of about 900°F (475°C), hotter than Mercury, despite being farther from the Sun. This is due to a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, creating a runaway greenhouse effect.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Day Longer Than Year:</span> A day on Venus (one full rotation) lasts about 243 Earth days, while a year (one orbit around the Sun) is only 225 Earth days.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Retrograde Rotation:</span> Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets in the Solar System, including Earth, meaning the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Thick Cloud Layers: </span> Venus is shrouded by clouds made of sulfuric acid, making it nearly impossible to see its surface from space. These clouds reflect about 70% of sunlight, contributing to Venus's bright appearance in the sky.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Earth's "Twin":</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/Terrestrial_planet_size_comp_2024.png" alt="" id="MImages"> Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" because of its similar size, mass, and composition, though its conditions are much more extreme.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Wind Speed: </span> The winds in Venus's upper atmosphere can reach speeds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h), much faster than the planet's rotation.</li><br>
        <li><span>Volcanic Activity:</span> <br> <br> <img src="Images file/PIA00103_Venus_-_3-D_Perspective_View_of_Lavinia_Planitia.jpg" alt="" id="MImages"> Venus is believed to have many large volcanoes, with some thought to still be active today. These volcanoes are primarily shield volcanoes, similar to those found on Earth, and could be contributing to the planet's extreme temperatures.</li><br>

    <h3>Exploration and Missions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Mariner 2 (1962):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/203288main_PIA04594_full.webp" alt="" id="MImage"> Launched by NASA, Mariner 2 was the first successful mission to Venus, providing the first data on the planet's atmosphere and surface temperature.</p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br> <br> <br>
        <li><span>Venus Express (2005–2014):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/Venus_Express_pillars.jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> The European Space Agency's Venus Express orbited Venus for nearly a decade, studying its atmosphere, surface, and the greenhouse effect.</p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br> <br> <br>
        <li><span>Parker Solar Probe (2018–Present):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/LARGE_MP4-12728_ParkerSolarProbe_17-01587_Solar_Probe_Trailer_v11_FINAL_large.00030_print.jpg" alt="" id="MImage"> NASA's Parker Solar Probe, launched in 2018, conducted flybys of Venus to gain speed for its journey to the Sun. During these flybys, it captured the first visible-light images of Venus' surface from space.</p>

    <div id="Beyond">Fun Fact!
        <h6>It snows on the planet—but not with snowflakes like we know! Venus experiences metallic snow, where the upper atmosphere is so cold that it causes metals like sodium and potassium to condense and fall to the ground in a form of metallic snow. However, the surface is too hot to support any of these materials in solid form for long!</h6>
