        The astroid belt</header>
    <ul>
        <li> <span>Type:</span> Asteroid Belt (Region of numerous small rocky bodies)</li> <br>
        <li><span>Orbit Distance:</span> Between 2.1 AU and 3.3 AU from the Sun (1 AU is the distance from Earth to the Sun)</li><br>
        <li><span>Diameter:</span> The belt does not have a defined diameter, but the combined mass of all asteroids is about 4% that of Earth's Moon. The largest asteroid, Ceres, has a diameter of 940 km.</li><br>
        <li><span>Day Length:</span> Individual asteroids in the belt have different rotation periods, varying widely.</li><br>
        <li><span>Year Length:</span> Objects in the asteroid belt have orbital periods between 3 to 6 Earth years, depending on their distance from the Sun.</li><br>
        <li><span>Moons:</span> Some asteroids have moons, with over 300 known asteroid moons to date. For example, 243 Ida has a moon called Dactyl.</li><br>
        <li><span>Temperature:</span> Average temperature is approximately -73°C to -103°C (-100°F to -153°F), depending on the asteroid and location within the belt.</li> <br>
    </ul>
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        The asteroid belt is a vast region of space located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, containing millions of rocky bodies that vary in size from tiny dust particles to dwarf planets like Ceres. It formed over 4.5 billion years ago from remnants of the early solar system that never coalesced into a planet due to Jupiter's strong gravitational influence. The belt is sparsely populated, meaning the asteroids are spread far apart, making collisions rare. While most are irregularly shaped and composed of rock and metal, some contain ice. The asteroid belt plays a crucial role in understanding planetary formation and evolution.</p>
    <h3>Unique Features and Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Home to a Dwarf Planet:</span>  <br> <br> <img src="Images file/1379px-Ceres-Vesta-Eros_compared_to_Pluto-Charon.jpg" alt="" id="MImages">Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, is classified as both an asteroid and a dwarf planet, comprising about 40% of the belt's total mass.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Rare Collisions:</span> Despite containing millions of objects, the belt is so vast that collisions between asteroids are extremely rare.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Varied Composition:</span> Asteroids in the belt are categorized into three main types: carbon-rich (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metallic (M-type), each offering unique scientific insights.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Influence of Jupiter:</span> Jupiter's gravity prevents the asteroids from clumping together to form a planet, shaping the belt’s structure and dynamics.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Metallic Riches:</span> Some asteroids, like Psyche, contain high concentrations of metals, potentially worth trillions of dollars in resources.</li> <br>
        <li><span>Early Solar System Remnants:</span>   <br> <br> <img src="Images file/InnerSolarSystem-en.png" alt="" id="MImages">The asteroids are ancient leftovers from the solar system's formation, offering insights into its history and composition.</li><br>
        <li><span>Not a Death Zone:</span>Unlike its portrayal in movies, the asteroid belt is mostly empty, and spacecraft like NASA's Dawn mission easily navigate through it without damage.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Exploration and Missions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Galileo (1989):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/galileospacecraft2.webp" alt="" id="MImage"> Launched by NASA, Galileo was the first spacecraft to fly past asteroids in the main belt. It conducted flybys of asteroid Gaspra in 1991 and asteroid Ida in 1993, discovering that Ida has a small moon named Dactyl.</p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br> <br>
        <li><span>Psyche (Launched 2023):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/psyche-launches.webp" alt="" id="MImage"> NASA's Psyche mission aims to explore the metal-rich asteroid 16 Psyche, believed to be the exposed core of a protoplanet. The spacecraft is expected to arrive at Psyche in 2029, providing insights into planetary formation.</p>
        </li> <br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
        <li><span>Emirates Mission to the Asteroid Belt (Planned for 2028):</span>
        <p> <img src="Images file/28ASTEROID-03-superJumbo.webp" alt="" id="MImage"> The United Arab Emirates Space Agency is developing a mission to visit seven asteroids, culminating in a rendezvous with asteroid 269 Justitia in 2034. This ambitious project aims to enhance our understanding of asteroid composition and the early solar system. </p>
